# ux review

try-internal.aut.id

**font is really nice!**

# 1-st scenario: member
  * (on showcase-internal.aut.id)
  unable to apply for the role:
  execution reverted Quest is not active
  although appears to be active on the frontend 


## 2-nd scenario: expander

  (chose to create from scratch option)

*  validation ux issues on dao creation:
    validation reverted reason wasn't highlighted 

* no alternative choice on the step 2 when specifying dao goals

    idea: a set of tags instead? or 
    "fill later option?" 

* should automatically redirect to "claim step" once dao expander is created 

* aut dashboard -- invalid redirect on 3-rd step

* username gets capitalized (in the top-right corner) even if wasn't originally
  
* tx state is not persisted on the backend (tx is not awaited after reload) 

* tasks only appear within quests. task creation outside quest doesn't reflect on the interface

* profile picture now is required. maybe use gravitars or so?
